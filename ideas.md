## Idea 1: "Digital Nostalgia & Lo-Fi Dreams"

### Design Movement
**Neo-Retro / Web Brutalism meets Lo-Fi Anime**
A blend of 90s web aesthetics, terminal interfaces, and cozy lo-fi anime vibes. It feels like a personal computer from a sentimental future.

### Core Principles
1.  **Raw & Honest:** Exposed structures, monospaced fonts, and ASCII art as primary visual elements.
2.  **Cozy & Sentimental:** Warm, muted colors and soft glowing effects to balance the raw tech feel.
3.  **Playful Interactivity:** Draggable elements, terminal command lines, and hidden "easter eggs" (little animals).
4.  **Narrative-Driven:** The scroll feels like reading a diary or exploring a memory card.

### Color Philosophy
**"Sunset in the Server Room"**
-   **Background:** Deep charcoal/slate (`#1a1b26`) or dark warm grey.
-   **Accents:** Terminal Green (`#41fa75`), Soft Pink (`#ff79c6`), and Muted Lavender (`#bd93f9`).
-   **Reasoning:** Reflects the "engineering" side (terminal) and the "sentimental" side (soft pinks/purples).

### Layout Paradigm
**The "Desktop" Metaphor**
-   Not a standard vertical scroll. The screen is a "desktop" with scattered "windows" (cards) for different sections.
-   Users can drag windows around.
-   Background has a 3D scene (Three.js) of a cozy room or a floating island that rotates slowly.

### Signature Elements
1.  **ASCII Hero:** A large ASCII portrait or landscape that animates on scroll.
2.  **Floating Companions:** Little 3D low-poly animals or 2D pixel-art anime characters that walk around the borders of windows.
3.  **Glitch Transitions:** Subtle CRT flicker or data-moshing effects when switching tabs.

### Interaction Philosophy
**"Tinkering"**
-   Buttons click with a satisfying mechanical sound (optional toggle).
-   Hover effects reveal raw code or ASCII versions of images.

### Animation
-   **Typewriter Effects:** Text appears character by character.
-   **Frame-by-Frame:** Animations feel slightly jerky (12fps) to mimic anime/retro styles.

### Typography System
-   **Headers:** `VT323` or `Press Start 2P` (Pixel/Terminal style).
-   **Body:** `Space Mono` or `JetBrains Mono` (Readable monospace).

## Idea 2: "Ethereal Math & Organic Flow"

### Design Movement
**Organic Modernism / Solarpunk**
Focuses on the beauty of math, nature, and connection. It uses fluid shapes, soft lighting, and generative art.

### Core Principles
1.  **Fluidity:** Everything flows into the next. No hard borders.
2.  **Mathematical Beauty:** Visuals derived from math concepts (fractals, golden ratio) but rendered softly.
3.  **Warmth & Light:** Represents the "sentimental" and "community" aspects through glowing, radiant visuals.
4.  **Living Interface:** The background reacts to mouse movement like water or wind.

### Color Philosophy
**"Golden Hour at Rice"**
-   **Background:** Cream/Off-white (`#fdfbf7`) or very soft peach.
-   **Accents:** Sage Green (`#84a98c`), Terracotta (`#e76f51`), and Deep Ocean Blue (`#264653`).
-   **Reasoning:** Earthy, grounded, yet intellectual and bright.

### Layout Paradigm
**The "Infinite Canvas"**
-   A continuous vertical scroll where sections morph into each other.
-   "Communities" section is a constellation map where nodes are pictures.
-   "Engineering" projects are floating bubbles.

### Signature Elements
1.  **Three.js Particles:** A particle system that forms shapes (animals, math symbols) based on the section.
2.  **Watercolor Textures:** Backgrounds have a subtle watercolor paper texture.
3.  **Hand-Drawn Accents:** Anime-style sketches of characters or animals overlaid on clean UI.

### Interaction Philosophy
**"Gentle Discovery"**
-   Hovering expands elements slowly and softly.
-   Parallax scrolling gives depth to the "memories" (photos).

### Animation
-   **Morphing:** Shapes smoothly transform into others.
-   **Floating:** Elements have a perpetual gentle bobbing motion.

### Typography System
-   **Headers:** `Cormorant Garamond` or `Playfair Display` (Elegant serif).
-   **Body:** `Outfit` or `Satoshi` (Clean, friendly sans-serif).

## Idea 3: "Cyber-Kawaii & High-Tech Heart"

### Design Movement
**Y2K Futurism / Cyber-Pop**
High energy, vibrant, mixing advanced tech aesthetics with cute (kawaii) elements.

### Core Principles
1.  **Bold & Expressive:** High contrast, neon colors, glassmorphism.
2.  **Tech-Savvy:** Showcases the "Applied Math" and "Startups" side with sleek, futuristic UI.
3.  **Playfully Cute:** Anime mascots and little animals are integrated as "assistants" or UI elements.
4.  **Dynamic Depth:** Heavy use of Three.js for depth, glass layers, and 3D objects.

### Color Philosophy
**"Neon Tokyo Dream"**
-   **Background:** Deep Blue/Purple Gradient.
-   **Accents:** Electric Cyan (`#00f3ff`), Hot Pink (`#ff0099`), and Bright Yellow (`#ffee00`).
-   **Reasoning:** Matches the energy of content creation and startups.

### Layout Paradigm
**The "HUD" (Heads-Up Display)**
-   Fixed sidebar navigation that looks like a sci-fi cockpit.
-   Content areas are "holographic" panels.
-   Background is a 3D city or abstract data stream that you fly through as you scroll.

### Signature Elements
1.  **3D Mascot:** A custom 3D anime character or animal that sits in the corner and reacts to scroll (Three.js).
2.  **ASCII Video:** Video backgrounds (UGC) rendered with an ASCII shader effect on hover.
3.  **Glass Cards:** Frosted glass effect for all content containers.

### Interaction Philosophy
**"Gamified"**
-   Snappy transitions.
-   Cursor trails.
-   Interactive 3D objects you can spin.

### Animation
-   **Glitch & Slide:** Fast, energetic entrances.
-   **Physics-based:** Elements bounce and react to collision.

### Typography System
-   **Headers:** `Orbitron` or `Syne` (Futuristic/Wide).
-   **Body:** `Inter` or `DM Sans` (Clean, legible).
